### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm John, a full stack web developer & software engineer. Below you can see some of the projects I've worked on. 

I have used Javascript, React, Node.js, and other technologies to create some of these projects. 

Most of the back-ends have been built in Node.js. Most front-ends have been built in React. 

For database creation, we used Knex. Deployment was generally to Heroku or AWS.

Enjoy!
